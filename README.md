# Project 05: 42_so_long

##  Making a simple 2D game using 42 minilibx

Only a few rules to abide to.
* The file passed to the executable, called a map (I created a few instances in the maps directory), must have a .ber extension. 
* The content of said map must represent a rectangle that should be surrounded by walls materialized by the 1 character.
* There must be at least one 'E' standing for "Exit" and one 'C' for "Collectible".
* There has to be only one 'P' that represents the player's starting position.
